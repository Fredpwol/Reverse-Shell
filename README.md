Reverse shell for gaining access of a remote user terminal and for data interchange

The server communicate with the client by sending it commands to execute on the client machine and thereby highjacking the client machine.

the client machine has to be listening to the server ip address in other to funcion well.

## How to get it on the client system
This is the hard part of this. it is left to you, you can either gain physical access to the system or send it by any means possible to the client machine.

## Commands
- list => list all connected devices
- select => select a connected device from it's id
- download => download a file to the server from the remote system give the path.
- send => send a file from the server to the client system.
- quit => exit from a client session
